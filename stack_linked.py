"""ITECC04 Laboratory 4, Part A2: the linked-list-based stack.

Same public interface as ArrayStack. Different storage, same contract. That
is the point of the exercise: code that uses a stack should not be able to
tell which one it was handed.

The HEAD of the list is the top. Pushing means making a new node whose next
is the old top. Popping means moving the head forward one node. Neither walks
the list, so both are O(1), the same as the array version.

You wrote Node in Chapter 3. This one is given so you can spend the time on
the stack itself.
